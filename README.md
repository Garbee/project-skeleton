# Project Name

> One line summary of the project.

Provide a quick description of your project here.
No one is going to read the code to get sold on it so it is your job to make sure developers understand its purpose.
Don't go on too long, keep it short and simple.

## Documentation

**Link** to your documentation here.
It can be housed under the `docs` folder to start.
While that is great for simple projects, larger projects may want to do a custom `gh-pages` documentation setup or have it hosted elsewhere.

## Support

Let people know if and how you are able to support them.
Some projects may be fine doing tech support in the issue tracker, however it is encouraged places like StackOverflow be used instead.
Whatever your project does to help people, make sure it is clearly defined here.

## License

Put your license information here.
Remember to change the `LICENSE` file in this repository to reflect your projects requirements.
You are free to alter the license of this project fully without keeping the public domain license in place or providing any reference back to this project.
